# Data Exploration
In this phase, we will begin the process of exploring a transactional dataset to see if it will be good for model training.  We will read a CSV file from a Domino Data Source into a Dataframe, clean the data, generate some visualizations, and save the data to a Domino Data Set.  We will begin from within your copy of the "Fraud Detection Workshop" project.



## Exercise Instructions

1.  Click "Workspace" (Left-hand column) and click "Jupyter Lab"

2.  Click "Next" 4x and then "Create"
    - Feel free to look around but do not change anything.

3.  Review Workspace Creation Workflow

4.  Review Workspace UI & Lefthand Sidebar

5.  Open the Notebook /mnt/code..../.../...

6.  In Data Sources at Left, Copy the Python Snippet

7.  Paste Python Snippett in Cell Where Instructed

8.  Run notebook cells (either manually or automatically)

9.  Review generated MetaData and Plots

10. Follow Path to Updated Location in Workspace.

11.  Save and Commit Code

This concludes the "2. Data Exploration" section of the workshop

## New Domino Concepts
**Workspaces:** 
> A Domino workspace is an interactive session where you can conduct research, analyze data, train models, and more. Use workspaces to work in the development environment of your choice, like Jupyter notebooks, RStudio, VS Code, and many other customizable environments.

**Data Source Connector:** 
> Managed data connectors that can connect to SQL and file-type stores.  Connectors provide an easy and secure way to connect to external data without drivers or configuration. Direct connections use the same code you would use outside of Domino, with the flexibility to access files or data however you want.

**Domino Dataset:**
> A Domino Dataset is a versioned, centralized data repository that enables teams to share, track, and manage data assets across projects and experiments. This ensures data consistency and reproducibility while providing governance controls and lineage tracking, eliminating the need for data scientists to manage their own copies of data.

**Compute Environments:**
> Compute Environments are pre-configured, containerized environments that package all the tools, libraries, and dependencies needed for data science work. They enable instant reproducibility and portability of work across teams while eliminating environment setup overhead and "it works on my machine" issues.

**Hardware Tiers:**
> Hardware Tiers are predefined compute resource configurations (CPU, GPU, memory) that users can select based on their workload requirements. This allows organizations to optimize costs by right-sizing resources for each task while giving data scientists flexibility to scale up for intensive computations without IT intervention.
